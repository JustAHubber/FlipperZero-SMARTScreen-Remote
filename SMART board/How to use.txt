Simply download these two files
Open your flipper's directory via an SD card reader or the qflipper application
Put these files into the "infrared" folder as well as any child folders you desire
On your flipper, locate these remotes and play around with the buttons

The buttons should be pretty self explanatory; The "wireless" and "OPS" are casting the display I believe.
